I was home alone and scared out of my Lungs[n]. I could hear the wind
Whistling[v], and off in the distance a Shadow[n]
was howling. I crossed the room, locked the Door[n], and
climbed into bed, pulling the Blanket[n] over my Legs[n]
Then it happened. I could hear a Creatuer[n] Running[v] up the stairs.
My Arms[n] started to chatter and my knees
Began Shivering[v].
The Door[n] was thrust open and there was a huge Creature[n] with hair all over his arms[n]. it was my father. Hi, we're home he said Happily[a]
Hope you were not afraid of staying home alone. No, I said, lying.
